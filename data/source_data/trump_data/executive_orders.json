The order declares that the Trump Administration will uphold the statutes that establish a uniform Election Day and require votes be cast and received by the election date established in law. In order to enforce the federal prohibition on foreign nationals voting in federal elections, the order mandates the verification of U.S. citizenship for voter registration, including documentary proof, and calls for improved systems to identify unqualified voters. Federal agencies will assist states in determining whether individuals are eligible to register and vote, the Election Assistance Commission is directed to ensure voting systems meet integrity standards, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is directed to prioritize the prosecution of election-related crimes and coordinate information sharing with state officials. Furthermore, the order directs the U.S. attorney general and the secretary of homeland security to prevent noncitizens from being involved in the administration of any federal election in order to improve the security of voting equipment used to cast ballots and tabulate votes."

The U.S. attorney general and the director of national intelligence, along with other relevant department heads, will take steps to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Paul Weiss and Mark Pomerantz. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will identify all government items provided for the benefit of Paul Weiss and cease such provision to the extent permitted by law. Government contractors will be required to disclose any business they do with Paul Weiss and if that business is related to the subject of the government contract. The heads of all agencies shall review and take steps to terminate any contract with Paul Weiss or with entities that disclose doing business with Paul Weiss. Within 30 days of this order, all agencies will submit an assessment of contracts with Paul Weiss and entities that do business with Paul Weiss to the OMB director. With this, employees of Paul Weiss will have guidance limiting official access from federal government buildings, and government employees will be limited in engaging with Paul Weiss employees. Agency officials will also refrain from hiring employees of Paul Weiss."

This stockpile will be, with all digital assets, owned by the Treasury Department other than BTC. Within 30 days of the order, each agency will transfer all BTC held to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. They will also transfer any stockpile assets to the United States Digital Assets Stockpile. Within 30 days, each agency will provide the treasury secretary and the President's Working Group on Digital Asset markets with a full accounting of their Government Digital Assets. This BTC in the reserve will not be sold and kept as reserve assets of the U.S. The secretaries of the treasury and commerce will develop strategies for acquiring more government BTC that are budget neutral. Within 60 days of this order, the treasury secretary will evaluate the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile, along with the logistics of the two offices moving forward."

The investigation will review current and projected demand for copper, the extent of domestic production, the role of foreign supply chains, concentrated imports from a small number of suppliers, the economic impact of artificially suppressed copper prices, potential export restrictions by foreign nations, feasibility of increasing domestic copper mining and the impact of current trade policies. The secretary of commerce will consult the secretaries of defense, interior, energy and other relevant executive department heads. Within 270 days of this report, the secretary of commerce will submit a report to the president on the findings on whether the U.S. dependence on copper imports threatens national security and any recommendations on actions to mitigate such threats. The report will also include policy recommendations for strengthening the U.S. copper supply chain."

The order applies the definition used in Executive Order 14168. All executive departments and agencies are to review grants to educational programs and potentially rescind funding if they fail to comply with the policies of this order. The secretary of education will use Title IX enforcement actions against education institutions, including athletic associations composed or governed by such institutions, that allow transgender women to compete in women's categories or to appear unclothed before them. The order aims to promote policy changes of transgender women allowed to compete if they reduce levels of their testosterone to provide documentation of 'sincerely held' gender identity. To accomplish change in policy, the assistant to the president for domestic policy will create meetings with female athletes harmed by these policies and major athletic organizations by April 6, 2025. The assistant to the president for domestic policy will also work with state attorneys general on how to define and enforce equal opportunities for women in sports and educate about stories of those harmed by April 6, 2025. The secretary of state and representative of the U.S. to the United Nations (UN) will not support or participate in sports where the female category is based on identity and not sex, and they will promote rule changes at the UN and international athletic associations. The secretaries of state and homeland security will review policies and adjust if needed of permitting transgender women who want to participate in women's sports into the U.S. and will issue guidance preventing these entries. The secretary of state shall also work to amend the standards of the International Olympic Committee to promote fairness, safety and the best interest of female athletes by ensuring that participation is based on sex and not identity or testosterone."

Ambassador will review all international intergovernmental organizations the U.S. is a part of and provide types of funding or support. The review will assess if these organizations, conventions and treaties are contrary to the interests of the U.S. and whether they can be reformed. The secretary of state will also inform the U.N. secretary general and leadership of the UNRWA and U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights that the U.S. is no longer funding the UNRWA or UNHRC, and the U.S. also will not satisfy any claim to pay 2025 assessments or prior arrears by these organizations."

It also addresses the concern that schools are indoctrinating children with radical gender and race theories that force children to adopt victim or oppressor identities based on characteristics such as skin color, as well as question their gender identity and undergo irreversible procedures without parental consent. These practices undermine personal identity, family unity and parental authority, and often violate anti-discrimination civil rights laws. This order calls for the rescinding of federal funding for illegal and discriminatory practices in K-12 schools, ensures the protection of parental rights and promotes the advancement of patriotic education."

The order further directs the secretary of state and secretary of homeland security, along with the director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), to require that all government-issued identification documents, including passports and federal employment records, reflect only biological 'sex' as defined in the order. The order also instructs agencies to 'evaluate grant conditions and grantee preferences' to ensure federal funds are not used to 'promote gender ideology.' It also instructs the secretary of housing and urban development (HUD) to prepare policies protecting women seeking single-sex rape shelters and requires the Bureau of Prisons to revise its medical care policies to correspond with the order's definition of sex. Agencies shall also ensure that intimate spaces designated for women/girls/females (or men/boys/males) are designated by the order's definition of sex and not identity."

The order also directs the interior secretary to deny a request pending before the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to establish an Indigenous sacred site in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, rescind the National Park Service's final rule entitled 'Alaska; Hunting and Trapping in National Preserves' (July 3, 2024), and review the framework of hunting, fishing and subsistence rights in Alaska."
