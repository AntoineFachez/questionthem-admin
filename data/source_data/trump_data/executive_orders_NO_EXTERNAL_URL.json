    "short_executiveSummary": "This executive order aims to promote a reliable, secure and resilient domestic copper supply chain. The secretary of commerce will have an investigation on the effects on national security of imports of copper in all forms. The investigation will review current and projected demand for copper, the extent of domestic production, the role of foreign supply chains, concentrated imports from a small number of suppliers, the economic impact of artificially suppressed copper prices, potential export restrictions by foreign nations, feasibility of increasing domestic copper mining and the impact of current trade policies. The secretary of commerce will consult the secretaries of defense, interior, energy and other relevant executive department heads. Within 270 days of this report, the secretary of commerce will submit a report to the president on the findings on whether the U.S. dependence on copper imports threatens national security and any recommendations on actions to mitigate such threats. The report will also include policy recommendations for strengthening the U.S. copper supply chain."

The order applies the definition used in Executive Order 14168. All executive departments and agencies are to review grants to educational programs and potentially rescind funding if they fail to comply with the policies of this order. The secretary of education will use Title IX enforcement actions against education institutions, including athletic associations composed or governed by such institutions, that allow transgender women to compete in women's categories or to appear unclothed before them. The order aims to promote policy changes of transgender women allowed to compete if they reduce levels of their testosterone to provide documentation of 'sincerely held' gender identity. To accomplish change in policy, the assistant to the president for domestic policy will create meetings with female athletes harmed by these policies and major athletic organizations by April 6, 2025. The assistant to the president for domestic policy will also work with state attorneys general on how to define and enforce equal opportunities for women in sports and educate about stories of those harmed by April 6, 2025. The secretary of state and representative of the U.S. to the United Nations (UN) will not support or participate in sports where the female category is based on identity and not sex, and they will promote rule changes at the UN and international athletic associations. The secretaries of state and homeland security will review policies and adjust if needed of permitting transgender women who want to participate in women's sports into the U.S. and will issue guidance preventing these entries. The secretary of state shall also work to amend the standards of the International Olympic Committee to promote fairness, safety and the best interest of female athletes by ensuring that participation is based on sex and not identity or testosterone."

The order also directs the interior secretary to deny a request pending before the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to establish an Indigenous sacred site in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, rescind the National Park Service's final rule entitled 'Alaska; Hunting and Trapping in National Preserves' (July 3, 2024), and review the framework of hunting, fishing and subsistence rights in Alaska."
